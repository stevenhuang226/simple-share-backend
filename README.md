# Introduce
- This is a "very" simple backend for file share
- Do not support folder. This mean cannot upload folders or retrieve files if they are inside a folder.
## The "config.h" file
- The example can be found in example directory as config-example.h
- Include settings for buffer size, API name, and other configurations.
- All placeholders in config.h must be filled, including:
1. API
2. HTML_FILE
## Build
```
make
```
- This will generate the default executale file named "server"
## clean
```
make clean

make clean_all
```
- clean: removes all files generated by the "make" command, except for the executable file.
- clean_all: removes all files generated by the "make" command, including the executable file.
